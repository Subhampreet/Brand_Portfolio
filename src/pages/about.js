            <p>With a passion for music, the stage and graphic design, I enjoy working with people who value aesthetics, who understand the power of simplicity and who know that a good customer experience is paramount.<br /><br/>By keeping your identity at the heart of my approach, my goal is to find the simplest solution to meet your needs. <br /><br/>My clients call on me for my efficiency, versatility and ease of communication (and also because I make incredible cookies, the secret is to put a lot of semi-salted butter in them).</p>
